## Setup: React + Vite

This project uses **React** with **Vite**, a fast front-end tool optimized for modern web applications, which includes Hot Module Replacement (HMR) and ESLint rules for a clean coding experience. Two official plugins are available for React setup in Vite:

- **[@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md)**: Uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh.
- **[@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc)**: Uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for even faster Fast Refresh.

This minimal setup offers a streamlined development environment for efficient coding.
